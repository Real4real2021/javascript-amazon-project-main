## Amazon Clone

### Overview
This project is a simplified clone of Amazon, built primarily using JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. Its primary purpose is to serve as a learning platform for practicing and solidifying JavaScript development concepts.

### Features
* **Basic UI Structure:** Replicates the core layout of Amazon's homepage, including header, search bar, product categories, and product listings.
* **Product Catalog:** Displays a simulated product catalog with basic product information.
* **Product Details:** Provides detailed product information for selected items.
* **Shopping Cart:** Implements basic shopping cart functionality, allowing users to add and remove items.
* **User Authentication:** (Optional) Includes a simple login/signup system for user management.

### Technology Stack
* **Frontend:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript
* **Backend:** (Optional) Node.js, Express.js for API endpoints (for more advanced features)

### Learning Objectives
* Reinforce fundamental JavaScript concepts: variables, data types, operators, control flow, functions, objects, arrays, and loops.
* Master DOM manipulation for building interactive user interfaces.
* Practice event handling and user interactions.
* Explore advanced JavaScript features: closures, higher-order functions, and modules.
* Implement object-oriented programming principles using JavaScript classes.
* Understand asynchronous programming with callbacks, promises, and async/await.
* Learn about testing and test-driven development (optional).
